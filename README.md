# Google-Analytics

I participated in the Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction competition on Kaggle for a group project in a Big Data Analytics class at Utah State University. The main point of the project was to get our hands dirty with big datasets and at least basic machine learning techniques. The project was done entirely in R, and the final R Markdown and pdf files are included.

Here is the description for the Kaggle competition.

>The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businesses–only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies.

>RStudio, the developer of free and open tools for R and enterprise-ready products for teams to scale and share work, has partnered with Google Cloud and Kaggle to demonstrate the business impact that thorough data analysis can have.

>In this competition, you’re challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.

The models were judged based on RMSE. Our model got and RMSE of 1.8618, which was decent (not last in the competition or in the class), but not great. Even though we didn't get the best score, it was a great experience taking a project through all the way from data processing to prediction.
